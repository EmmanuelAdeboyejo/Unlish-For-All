    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <h2>The Earth's atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases.
        Earth is the only planet in the solar system known to have liquid water on its surface.
        The Earth's core is primarily made up of iron and nickel.
        The highest point on Earth, Mount Everest, is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level.
        The lowest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, reaches a depth of about 10,994 meters (36,070 feet).
        Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core.
        The Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.
        The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down at a rate of about 17 milliseconds per hundred years.
        Earth is the only planet not named after a deity.
        The Earth's surface is constantly changing due to processes like erosion, volcanic activity, and tectonic plate movement.
        The Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).
        The Earth's atmosphere protects life on the planet by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.
        The Earth experiences four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) due to its axial tilt and orbit around the Sun.
        Earth's oceans cover about 71% of its surface.
        The Earth's moon is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system.
        Earth's rotation causes the bulging at the equator, making it slightly wider at the equator than at the poles.
        The Earth's atmosphere extends about 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) above the planet's surface.
        The Earth's ozone layer helps protect life on the planet by absorbing most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.
        Earth's landmasses are divided into seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia.
        The Earth's crust is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below.
        Earth's atmosphere is responsible for the phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, which helps regulate the planet's temperature.
        The Earth's rotation causes the apparent movement of the Sun across the sky, creating day and night.
        Earth's atmosphere contains approximately 1% water vapor.
        The Earth's magnetic poles are not aligned perfectly with its geographic poles.
        Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down due to tidal forces caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun.
        Earth's atmosphere is divided into several layers, including the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere.
        Earth's oceans contain about 97% of the planet's water, with the remaining 3% found in ice caps, glaciers, and freshwater sources.
        The Earth's magnetic field helps protect the planet from harmful solar winds and cosmic rays.
        The Earth's rotation is counterclockwise when viewed from above the North Pole.
        Earth's surface is constantly reshaped by processes such as erosion, weathering, and deposition.
